# PROJECT 2: Meal Buddy

## Description

For this project our group wanted to create a functional web application that would aid the user in the planning of daily meals throughout the week. Sometimes deciding on a meal is one of the hardest things to do when planning your week. With our application the user can plan out their week by planning specific meals on specific days. These meals can be deleted and re-added at the click of a button.  The user also has the ability to add multiple dishes for specific meals. The application also has the ability to send a welcome e-mail when the user signs up for the service.  


## Learning Obstacles
Throughout the creation of this application our team learned how complicated it can be when creating a full stack application.  We had trouble with nodemailer and the Gmail api when trying to run the application through heroku.  Unfortunately G-Mail's security measures were too much to overcome within the time limit.  We are however working on an Oauth2 token so that the e-mail component will be functional on the live site as well as on the local server.  We also ran into difficulties when trying to connect our database to Jawsdb.  Fortunately we were able to establish that connection.

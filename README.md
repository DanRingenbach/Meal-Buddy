# PROJECT 2: Shopping Cart
# A Grand Day Out
## Description

For this project our group wanted to create a functional web application that would aid the user in the planning of daily meals throught the week. Sometimes deciding on a meal is one of the hardest things to do when planning your week. With our application the user can plan out their week by planning specific meals on specific days.  

Through the building of this application my partner and I learned how to access data from multiple API calls and how to interpret and display that data for a user.

## Usage
To use our application **A Grand Day Out** all the user has to do is input their city of choice in the form on the homepage. After submitting the user is then presented with a list of recreation sites and the air quality index of the selected city. A back button is provided for the user to return to the homepage and input another city as necessary.
